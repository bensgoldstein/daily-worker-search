### Effective Search Strategies

**1. Ask Complete Questions**
- Use full sentence questions: "What was the Daily Worker's coverage of the 1935 Wagner Act?"
- Frame queries as research questions: "How did the paper report on women's roles in labor organizing?"
- Be conversational: "What did the Daily Worker think about Roosevelt's economic policies?"

**2. Leverage Historical Context**
- Use period-appropriate terminology and names
- Search for "Great War" instead of "World War I" for 1920s coverage
- Consider how events were understood at the time
- Remember the paper's socialist perspective when framing questions

**3. Build on Previous Searches**
- Use the conversational mode - each search builds on previous context
- Ask follow-up questions: "How did this change over time?" or "What was the response to this?"
- Explore different angles: "What was the international perspective on this issue?"
